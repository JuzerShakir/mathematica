## Factorial

### ‚ùó Problem Details
> [What is factorial?](https://www.cuemath.com/numbers/factorial/)
> [Why 0! = 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X32dce7_D48&ab_channel=EddieWoo)

Should return the factorial for any integer input which is greater than 0.

#### ‚å®Ô∏è Example input:
```bash
19
```

#### üíª Expected output:
```bash
121645100408832000
```


### ‚úîÔ∏è Solution Details

1. Check user input, `n`, exit program for negative input.
2. Initiate a variable, `total`, which will hold the factorial of n with value `1` as 0! is equal to 1.
3. Initiate a loop which will initiate from integer `1` to `n` where for each iteration the varaible `total` will be updated with the product of the number its iterating at, `i`, and `total`, where `total` holds the value of previous iteration.


Ruby provides a funtion `Math.gamma` which returns the approximation factorial of n-1 for any n greater than 0. I have also used this function in the program to compare the results with the logic code I created. The answer of this method changes slightly compared to my logic as we give high input numbers as `gamma` is an approximation.


The solution of this problem can be found in `factorial/program.rb` file.


#### üìã Local Execution

## Factors

### ‚ùó Problem Details
> [What is factors?](https://www.britannica.com/science/factor-mathematics)

Should return list of factors in ascending order for any integer input which is greater than equal to 1.

#### ‚å®Ô∏è Example input:
```bash
100
```

#### üíª Expected output:
```ruby
[1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100]
```

1. Check user input, `n`, exit program for negative input.
2. If user input is `1` then end the program with the output `1`.
3. If user input is greater than 1 then initiate an array `factors` which will hold all the numbers that are factors of `n`. We know for any number `n`,  `1` and `n` itself are common factors, hence we initiate array with these 2 factors.
4. Since we know that prime numbers have no factors other than `1` and `n` itself, we check for it with the help of `prime` library and end the program.
5. Now, for composite numbers we initiate a loop which will initiate from integer `2` (since we know `1` is a factor for any `n` where `n > 0`) to `n-1` (with same logic) where for each iteration it will check the following:
  5.1. Stop the loop if the loop variable `factor` is already in our `factors` array. This means its calculation is already been done and also for the numbers till `n`.
  5.2. If number isn't in `factors` then we check if `n` is fully divisible by `factor`. If it is divisible it will return 0. And then we append the `factor` in `factors`. After that we would also like to append another factor `second_factor` to `factors` list for which `factor` was fully divisible. To find `second_factor`, we do `n / factor`. Before adding `second_factor` to list we check if its equal to `factor`, because for many `n` such as 36 where its square root is 6, it has both `factor` and `second_factor` as 6. If both are equal we dont add to `factors` to avoid duplicate entries and this also means that no new factors of `n` will be found so we stop the loop. If they aren't equal we append to `factors`.
  5.3. Next iteratiom.
6. Finally, we have our `factors` array of `n`. We show the list to the user by arranging numbers in ascending order with `.sort` method.


The solution of this problem can be found in `factors/program.rb` file.
